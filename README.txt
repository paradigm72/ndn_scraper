Example of a web-scraping web app that uses Python (and the BeautifulSoup parsing library). It abuses the Django framework just to get a quick way to execute a Python script from an AJAX call - not good Django practice at all I don't think.

Mostly done as an exercise to learn a real-world application of Python, and to create a version of NDNation that is easier to read. Could be adapted to other websites by updating the logic in html_core.py, as much as of that is site-specific.
